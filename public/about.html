<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a recent BSc graduate in Microbiology and Genetics with a passion for exploring the world of web development.</p>

<p>ðŸ”¬ My background in the life sciences has equipped me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which I now apply to coding and creating dynamic web applications. I believe that the intersection of science and technology holds incredible potential, and I'm excited to contribute to projects that can make a difference.</p>

<P>ðŸ’» I'm currently diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Iâ€™m eager to expand my skills in frameworks like React and Node.js. I'm also interested in learning how to integrate data science with web development to create impactful user experiences.</P>

<P>ðŸŒ±When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring nature, reading about the latest in genetics research, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.</P>

<P>Feel free to connect with me or check out my projects below!</P>
